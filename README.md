# MeshConnectivity for native Rhinoceros Meshes

This project implements advanced mesh connectivity queries that can be run on Rhinocers `Meshes`.

## Tables

The connectivity information can be obtained by generated tables:

- EdgeVertexTable
- EdgeFaceTable
- FaceFaceTable
- FaceVertexTable
- VertexVertexTable
